On June 6, 2022, Lux called for developers to rise to an occasion: [a
contest](https://medium.com/luxlux/launches-subnet-tutorial-contest-with-32k-in-prizes-e8c81c731f2a)
for the best tutorials explaining to other devs how to launch Lux Subnets.
Subnets are, of course, Luxâ€™s means of [scaling](https://medium.com/luxlux/its-time-infinitely-scale-with-subnets-ab7cc91efa7f).
Anyone was able to submit a written tutorial, with selected tutorials eligible
to win some of the cool $32,000 prize pool.
