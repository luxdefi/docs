# Get Test Funds from the Fuji Testnet Faucet

The [Fuji Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.lux.network) sends LUX to X-Chain or C-Chain
addresses to help you test. (This testnet LUX has no value.)

We can get a "drip" of LUX from the Fuji faucet. Paste the address into the
[Fuji faucet website](https://faucet.lux.network). These LUX are for the Fuji
Testnet and have no monetary value.

The faucet will send some LUX to the address and return a transaction ID
(txID). This txID can be used with the Fuji Testnet Explorer to learn more about
the transaction.
