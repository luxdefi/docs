# Why is Coinbase Transfer Taking So Long?

If your transfer from Coinbase is delayed, it may be due to the exchange's security measures, such as detecting unusual log-ins or transfer sizes. This triggers a need for additional verification.

## Understanding the Delay
- **72-Hour Hold**: The delay typically lasts 72 hours, after which your swap will be processed automatically.

## What You Can Do
1. **Wait 72 Hours**: Allow time for the transfer to be processed.
2. **Identity Verification**: Complete identity verification on Coinbase to expedite the process. Look for details in your email.
