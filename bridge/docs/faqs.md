### Does Lux Bridge Require KYC?
No, KYC is not required for transfers via Lux Bridge. However, KYC may be requested by Centralized Exchanges for high swap amounts or if suspicious activity is detected.

### Can the Actual Withdrawal Amount Differ from the Requested Amount?
Yes. If you manually withdraw more or less than the specified amount on Lux Bridge, the transfer will be completed with the sent amount. You will receive the exact amount sent at the destination address. Note that the amount should still be within the limits shown on Lux Bridge.
