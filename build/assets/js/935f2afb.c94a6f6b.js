To ensure your node has a complete index, run a node with a fresh database and --index-enabled set to true. The node will accept every block, vertex and transaction in the network history during bootstrapping, ensuring your index is complete. It is OK to turn off your node if it is running with indexing enabled. If it restarts with indexing still enabled, it will accept all containers that were accepted while it was offline.
