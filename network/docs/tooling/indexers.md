### SubQuery

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project.

### Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) provides real-time and historical custom data indexing for any EVM-compatible chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.
